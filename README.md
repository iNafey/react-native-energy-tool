# react-native-energy-tool


## Overview

The inspiration behind this app is for the following reasons:
 
* I wanted to work on a react native project to learn about hybrid/native development.
* Main purpose of the project is to create an energy tool with authentication, authorization and ability for users to perform CRUD actions on their energy bills.
* There is a unique form of payment using EVC energy vouchers (Can be scanned in app via QR codes or an 8-digit text input).

### App functionalities (up to this point):

* Working login and registration with validation (using react form hooks).
* Firebase user authentication.
