# react-native-energy-tool


## Overview

The inspiration behind this app is for the following reasons:
 
* I wanted to work on a react native project to learn about hybrid/native development.
* Main purpose of the project is to create an energy tool with authentication, authorization and ability for users to perform CRUD actions on their energy bills.
* There is a unique form of payment using EVC energy vouchers (Can be scanned in app via QR codes or an 8-digit text input).

### App functionalities (up to this point):

* All the features below only work on android devices (iOS not setup).
* Working login and registration with validation (using react form hooks).
* Working vision camera and QR/Barcode scanner (with a focus box).
* Firebase user authentication.
* Admin and Customer profiles (authorization) is setup. Which includes different screens for admin as compared to a regular user.
* Bottom tab navigator implemented.
* Loading screen (Activity Indicator) setup to display during firebase transactions.
